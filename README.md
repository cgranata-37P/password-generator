# Password-Generator  https://cgranata-37p.github.io/password-generator/

## Description
To modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. The goal is for users to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria so the passwords can provide greater security.

### Criteria
* When the user I clicks the button to generate a password they are presented with a series of prompts for  password criteria.
* When  prompted for password criteria, the user selects which criteria they want to include in the password.
* When the user is prompted for the length of the password, the user chooses a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters long.
* When the user is prompted for character types to include in the password, the user will have the option to choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters.
* When the user answers each prompt, the input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected.
* When all prompts are answered by the user, a password is generated that matches the selected criteria.
* When the password is generated, the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page.

### What I learned
* This was a very complicated task.  I learned about for loops, concating arrays together with random function using Math.floor(Math.random) methods, generating and calling functions, and promt, confirm, alert functions.
